My name is Joe Danks. First and foremost, I'm a father to two amazing girls, Adelaide and Delilah. Next, I'm a husband to my awesome wife, Emily. Finally, I'm a software developer who enjoys a challenge.

I spent five years working on software for Union Pacific Railroad. I was a part of building a business rules management system (BRMS) and designing rule engines for domain needs. I also spent some time working on the Terminal Management tool for tracking equipment and work inside a train yard.

I spent a brief stint at Rain and Hail Insurance working on a document processing workflow system. I did not feel challenged there and didn't stay long.

Now I'm with Source Allies and really enjoying it. I'm at a client who has some really challenging problems. My team is made up of awesome developers and awesome people.

This blog was build with Jekyll, I encourage you to check it out. It's pretty awesome!
